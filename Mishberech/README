Mishberech

There is a excel file on the (ktm) shul cloud website which holds all Mishberech
information. This file is laid out like:

Column #1: Empty
Column #2: Requesting person
Column #3: Choleh Name
Column #4: Date added
Column #5: Comments
Column #6: email address

The idea is that every month, we will run a process. This process will look
through the list, and send email to all the people requesting help.

If the record is more than 45 days old, we will send an email asking them
if they want to keep the name on the list, or not.

When we send the email, we update the comments columns - with the current date.
If people answer the email - great. If they ask them to stay on, you change
the date to the current date.

If they do not answer, you can delete their person after a few days (whatever
you determine.)
