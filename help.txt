This is a suite of utilities for synagogue office managers. I am
working in an office, and it seems like some of these may be helpful
for other people.

This version is for windows.

=========================================================================
yahr: This program reformats an excel spread sheet from shulcloud, and
produces two spread sheets I can then print and put on the bimah for the
gabbai to read.

what do you need to do before using this?
1) go to shulcloud and download the yahrzeit list for the month
2) save that file as yahrzeits.xlsx in this 'msutils' directory.
3) click on .../msutils/bat/mBox.bat
4) a window comes up with buttons...
5) click on the button that says 'Build monthly yahrzeit list'

Result: excel should come up with a workbook called 'new.xlsx'.
This workbook will have three worksheets in it:
1) a copy of the old 'yahrzeits.xlsx'
2) a worksheet called 'males'
3) a worksheet called 'females'
